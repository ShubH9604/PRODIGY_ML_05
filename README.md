# House Price Prediction Model

This project is designed to predict the prices of houses based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. By using a Ridge regression model, the project aims to provide accurate predictions while mitigating the risk of overfitting. The project includes steps for generating synthetic data, visualizing it, training the model, and saving/loading the model for future use.

## Project Features

### 1. **Synthetic Data Generation**
   - The dataset used in this project is generated synthetically to simulate realistic housing data. The data includes various house features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the corresponding house price.
   - The large dataset ensures that the model is trained on a wide variety of data points, improving its ability to generalize to new data.

### 2. **Data Visualization**
   - To better understand the relationships between features and the target variable (house price), several visualizations are included:
     - **Scatter Plots**: Display the correlation between individual features and house prices.
     - **Histograms**: Show the distribution of features and target variable.
     - **Pair Plots**: Provide a comprehensive view of the interactions between all features.
   - These visualizations help in diagnosing potential issues and understanding the underlying patterns in the data.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - The project includes advanced feature engineering techniques such as:
     - **Polynomial Features**: These are generated to capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable.
     - **Feature Scaling**: Ensures that all features contribute equally to the model by standardizing them.

### 4. **Ridge Regression Model**
   - A Ridge regression model is used to train on the data. Ridge regression is chosen because it helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to large coefficients.
   - The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) to ensure it performs well on both the training and validation data.

### 5. **Model Persistence**
   - After training, the model is saved using the `pickle` library. This allows the model to be easily saved and loaded for making predictions without needing to retrain.
   - Saving the model ensures that it can be deployed or shared without losing its learned parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Pickle

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary Python libraries using a requirements file or manually via pip.

### Running the Project
- **Data Exploration and Visualization**: Open the provided Jupyter Notebook and explore the synthetic dataset through various visualizations. This step helps in understanding the data before moving to modeling.
- **Model Training**: Train the Ridge regression model on the dataset. The notebook guides you through feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **Model Saving**: Save the trained model for future predictions using `pickle`.
- **Model Loading and Prediction**: Load the saved model and make predictions on new data.

## Example Use Case
- After loading the model, you can input new house features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms) to predict the price of a house. The model provides an estimate based on the learned relationships from the training data.

## Files Included

- **`house_price_prediction.ipynb`**: The main notebook containing the entire workflow from data generation to model saving.
- **`house_price_model_2.pkl`**: The serialized model file that can be loaded for making predictions without retraining.
