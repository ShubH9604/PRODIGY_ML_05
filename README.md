# Food Calorie Recognition Project

This project focuses on building a food calorie recognition system using deep learning techniques. The system can classify food items into categories such as fruits and vegetables, predict the specific type of food, and retrieve calorie information through web scraping. The project is implemented using Python and Streamlit for the web interface.

## Project Features

### 1. **Deep Learning Model for Food Classification**
   - The core of the project is a deep learning model trained to classify food items into specific categories, such as fruits and vegetables.
   - The model is trained on a dataset of labeled food images, enabling it to accurately identify and categorize new food images.

### 2. **Food Calorie Prediction**
   - After classifying the food item, the system predicts its calorie content by fetching information from relevant sources via web scraping.
   - This feature provides users with an estimate of the caloric value of the food item based on its type.

### 3. **Streamlit Web Interface**
   - A user-friendly web interface is created using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model.
   - Users can upload images of food items, and the app will display the predicted category (fruit or vegetable), the specific type of food, and its estimated calorie content.
   - The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to a broad audience.

### 4. **Model Training and Testing**
   - The deep learning model is trained using a Jupyter Notebook, which includes steps for data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.
   - The notebook also contains code for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, allowing for thorough model evaluation.

### 5. **Model and Data Persistence**
   - The trained model is saved using `pickle`, enabling easy loading and use in the Streamlit app.
   - Additionally, the project includes functionality to save and reload the dataset and other relevant components to streamline the workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, OpenCV, BeautifulSoup (for web scraping), Pickle

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries using a `requirements.txt` file or manually via pip.
3. **Set Up Streamlit**: Ensure that Streamlit is installed and configured correctly to run the web interface.

### Running the Project
- **Data Preparation and Model Training**: Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to preprocess the dataset, train the deep learning model, and evaluate its performance. The notebook guides you through the entire process, from loading the data to saving the trained model.
- **Web Interface with Streamlit**: Launch the Streamlit app to interact with the model. The app allows you to upload food images and receive predictions on the food type and its calorie content.
- **Model Loading and Predictions**: The model is loaded into the Streamlit app, where it is used to make predictions on new food images provided by the user.

## Example Use Case
- Users can upload images of food items, and the app will classify the food, predict its type, and provide an estimated calorie count. This is useful for individuals tracking their dietary intake or for applications in health and fitness.

## Files Included

- **`FCR_modeltraining.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`FoodCalorieRecognition.h5`**: The saved deep learning model, serialized using `HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) file format`.
- **`streamlit_app.py`**: The main Python script to run the Streamlit web interface.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all the necessary Python libraries for the project.
- **`datasets/`**: Directory containing the dataset of labeled food images used for training and testing the model.
